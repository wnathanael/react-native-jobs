# First React-Native application

This is my first react native application that i created to learn react native. I created this app by following a [tutorial from youtube by JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ3bGvy0WAY&t=3224s). If you want to see a preview of the app, scan the barcode below and open the app in Expo go (you can download this from AppStore / Play Store).
